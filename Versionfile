# this was pre-deface-stable.  Honestly, I'm a bit confused at the moment regarding the differences between pre-deface-stable and spree-0-60-stable
#
# there have been many attempts to stay current as spree has progressed
#
# One challenge is there was a new railtie calculator registration that caused me to have to create another branch
#
# Another was maintaining a deface/non-deface version
#
# I'm not sure how much effort I'm going to put in to sorting out these older versions as it's non-trivial.
#
# if your are on spree 0.60, try spree-0-60-stable, and if that isn't working, try pre-deface-stable.
